# Predict Customer Churn

## Project Description
This project is intended to identify credit card customers who are most likely to churn. 
It is aimed to sharpen my skills for testing, logging, and best coding practices with this project. 

## Dependencies
To be able to run this, there are a few dependencies as listed below:
* scikit-learn==0.22,
* shap,
* pylint (to see the score out of 10 for pep8 standards: pylint churn_library.py),
* autopep8 (to automatically adjust code to follow pep8 standards: autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_library.py),
* update numpy (pip install -U numpy),
* update seaborn (pip install -U seaborn),
* pandas.

## Running Files
This repo have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI). 
By typing "python churn_library.py" in the command-line, one can get the model pickle files (in models directory), resulting images (in images directory).
One can also test codes and log the results in this repo by just running "python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py" in the command-line. You can see log file in the logs directory.
